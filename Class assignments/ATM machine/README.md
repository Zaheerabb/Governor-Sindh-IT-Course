# 🏧 ATM Simulator 🏧

This Node.js script simulates a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine) functionality, allowing users to check their balance and withdraw money.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run the script using `node main.js`.

## 📝 Usage

1. Upon running the script, you will be prompted to enter a PIN. The default PIN is `1234`.
2. Choose whether you want to access your current account or savings account.
3. View your account balance.
4. Choose the amount you want to withdraw from the provided options.
5. If the withdrawal amount exceeds your account balance, you will receive an error message.
6. If the withdrawal is successful, the remaining balance will be displayed.
7. You can choose to withdraw again or exit the ATM.

## 💡 Notes

- The script currently has hardcoded PIN and account balances for demonstration purposes.
- This is a simple simulation and does not interact with real banking systems.
